Bifrost is an application development framework promoting good development practices.

The backend development is focused on CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for promoting Domain Driven Design.

The fronted development is focused on MVVM (Model View ViewModel) for promoting better separation.

Originally developed by [dolittle](http://bifrost.dolittle.com), the project was forked after
[development stopped](http://www.ingebrigtsen.info/2016/02/11/bifrost-end-of-the-line/) in February 2016.
